    <h2 className='mt-7 text-lg'>I am a highly motivated technology professional with a background in fintech client care. Having the opportunity to do the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp while also in a tier 2 client care position has proven to be symbiotic in nature. Already being in the fintech industry provides me with a solid foundation for understanding key concepts, and the knowledge I’ve obtained thus far in this bootcamp enables me to deepen my investigative skills in my work, particularly in the area of troubleshooting with our API product.</h2>
    <h2 className='mt-7 text-lg'>In my professional life, I am frequently the first stop for our most complex issues, because I can get to the bottom of or determine next steps of almost any issue with my methodical, analytical mindset. One of my greatest strengths is my deep thirst for knowledge, as demonstrated by my ability to become a Subject Matter Expert in multiple areas of the system in less than a year. I have an investigative mindset that allows me to take a deep dive into complex issues as well as hone a testing oriented work style. These strengths give me what it takes to pivot from the client care side of technology into the engineering and development side, where I can utilize my full skillset and continue to blossom within the industry.</h2>
    <h2 className='mt-7 text-lg'>I married my wife Jessica in April 2022 and we recently moved to Evanston, IL. We both work from home, accompanied by our two grey cats (Luna & Milo), and the four plants we’ve managed to keep alive. In my free time, I enjoy drawing houses and buildings, making and altering my own clothes, and googling every random question that pops into my head about a concept or how something works.</h2>
